<p style='text-align: justify;'>

    <i>Acappella</i> is a 46h-dataset of people singing
    solos a cappella. It's composed by
    YouTube videos publicly available.
    The main aim is to provide a large-scale dataset
    to train audio-visual models for singing voice separation.
    Each recording has been manually selected to exclude parts
    of the videos that doesn't fit to these standars:
    single frontal face view without occlusions, minimal backgroundnoise,
    no beatboxing, no snapping  fingers,  songs  with  lyrics(e.g.we avoid humming and yodelling).
    The dataset comprises of 1693 different videos split across four languages:
    English, Spanish, Hindi and Others. The statistics can be shown in the figures below.

We also selected some demo videos and created a montage with ground-truth samples in order to evaluate the algorithm.  
In-depth details will be provided subject to paper acceptance.
