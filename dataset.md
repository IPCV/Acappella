*Acappella* is a 46h-dataset of people singing solos a cappella. It's composed by YouTube videos publicly available. The main aim is to provide a large-scale dataset to train audio-visual models for singing voice separation.   

Each recording has been manually selected to exclude parts of the videos that doesn't fit to these standars: single frontal face view without occlusions, minimal backgroundnoise,  no  beatboxing,  no  snapping  fingers,  songs  with  lyrics(e.g.we avoid humming and yodelling).  

The dataset comprises of 1693 different videos split across four languages: English, Spanish, Hindi and Others.  The statistics can be shown in the figures below.
