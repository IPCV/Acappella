title: The circle of life
subtitle: An acappella singing voice montage with ground-truth sources
---
Evaluating algorithms in real world examples is an important step to verify those work in real challenging situations. 
We recorded an amateur singer to compose a 6-voice montage which permits to evaluate in real world examples but having ground-truth sources to compare with.

To do so, we have chosen [The circle of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_Life) song. The reasons are:
* Two-languages song, english and zulu.  
* Humming-like sounds which are more challenging than separating lyrics.  
* Synchronized voices and chorals which are slightly delayed on time.  

We also add an instrumental backtrack in order to provide musical coherence and sonority.
