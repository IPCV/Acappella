        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_Life">Circle of life</a> is a song from Disney's Lion King film. We adapted it to a 6-voice a cappella montage
        thanks to Diana Ferrando, an amateur singer.  
        The track is composed by 1 leading voice (rafiki, bottom center), 4 voices which usually sing the same in pairs, one voice which emulates a backtrack and a base of percussion 
        instruments.  
        
        This is a challenging scenario as all the voices are performed by the same singer.
